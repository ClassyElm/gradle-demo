# Gradle Demo Project

This repository holds the project code used to demo a Gradle project using IntelliJ IDEA.

The code will build a web application that demonstrates a basic web page. In the page, a connection
is established with a basic users table within a sample database. On the demo page, each user is displayed
using JSP pages containing JSTL. The User entity classes are modeled using the javax persistence framework
in conjunction with Hibernate ORM. No unit tests were modeled in the application since the project was
entirely for demonstration purposes.
